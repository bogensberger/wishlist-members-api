# Wishlist Members Api in Python
Wishlist Member API (wlmapi2) is only offically available in PHP so I wrote it in Python 3.
[Wishlist Member](https://member.wishlistproducts.com/) is a WordPress membership plugin.

I coded this simple API in order to use it in a [professional project](https://hermione.co/) I have with some friends. 
The idea is to link wordpress membership system with a learning platform made with Django

## How to use it
Require python 3
```
$ pip install requests
```

Use [example.py](https://github.com/sylvain-reynaud/wishlist-members-api/blob/master/example.py) and the [offical doc](https://wishlistproducts.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wlmapi2doc.pdf) to learn how ot use it.
